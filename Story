Once Upon a time lived a boy in Kolkata, 11 years of age. Named Soustin.
Got a pet parrot on his birthday. He named it Kittu.
He and his family used to spend a lot of time with Kittu and have fun with him.
Kittu's Family used to leave him open in his home to roam around.
His mom and his family used to love Kittu!
Kittu couldn't even fly more than 4 feets long and height depending upon the situatiion.
He used to bring Kittu to where ever he went. He and his relatives had a close bonding with Kittu.
Two years later Soustin and his family had to transfer to Delhi, because his Dad worked as an Government Scientist.
One day on 05-07-2021 his grandmother let him free to roam around on his Kolkata's house in the morning, and somehow he escaped and flew away.
Since then he didn't came back yet no one knows where he is? if he has ate or not? and many more questions.
